# To-Do-List

To-Do List Web Application

This is a simple To-Do List web application built using React. Users can add and remove tasks from the list. The application consists of the following files:

1. index.html: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the web page and includes links to the required CSS styles and the JavaScript file for the React application.

2. styles.css: The CSS file that defines the styles for various elements in the application, such as background color, font styles, button styles, etc.

3. index.js: The main JavaScript file that uses React and ReactDOM to render the application. It imports and renders the App component.

4. App.jsx: The main component of the application. It manages the state of the to-do items and handles adding and deleting items.

5. InputArea.jsx: A sub-component responsible for the input field and "Add" button functionality. It communicates with the App component to add new to-do items.

6. ToDoItem.jsx: A sub-component that represents individual to-do items in the list. It receives a "delete" callback from the App component to remove items when clicked.

7. The application allows users to input new tasks, which are then added to the list. Each task item has a "Delete" option, and clicking it will remove the item from the list.

Usage:

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the To-Do List application.
3. Type a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
4. Click on a task to delete it from the list.
5. This is a basic To-Do List application built with React, serving as a starting point for more complex applications with additional features and functionalities.
